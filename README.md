# Drug-Recommendation-System-Based-on-Sentiment-Analysis
Performed Sentiment Analysis using basic Natural Language Processing to recommend drugs for a particular medical condition. Using NLTK, created pipeline and applied  ML algorithms  like LinearSVC, LogisticRegression. LinearSVC has the highest accuracy of 92.89 percentage. 



## Summary

The precision for the "positive" class is 0.93, which means that out of all the examples that were classified as "positive", 93% were actually positive. The recall for the "positive" class is 0.94, which means that out of all the actual positive examples, 94% were correctly identified as positive. The F1-score for the "positive" class is 0.93, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Similarly, for the "negative" class, the precision is 0.94, the recall is 0.92, and the F1-score is 0.93. These metrics indicate that the classifier is performing well for both classes, with similar scores for both.

The overall accuracy of the classifier is 0.93, which means that it correctly classified 93% of the examples in the dataset.
